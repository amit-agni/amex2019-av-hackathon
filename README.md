Analytics Vidhya Amex Hackathon
===============================

The American Express AmExpert 2019 Machine learning hackathon was hosted
between 28Sep-07Oct19 on [Analytics
Vidya](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/amexpert-2019-machine-learning-hackathon/)

The objective was to predict the probability that a customer will redeem
a coupon during marketing campaigns. I could not spend much time on this
competition as I was working on another project during the same period.
With limited feature engineering and model fine tuning I got a rank of
434/1000 with a LB AUC score of 0.797

The data schema was given as below :
